PART 2: Please answer the following self-reflection questions:
1. What  would you consider the most challenging  in learning your language in this month?
         Self Studying. We have self study in  the afternoon which I like  but  if we could  have  one more 
hour of  teacher instruction I would like that.
2. What  actions have  you  taken  that were  most helpful in meeting  your goals/challenges this 
month?
         Finding  outside textbook material to  explain concepts and topics to me. I don't find the book 
very helpful.
3. What  would you like  to focus on next month? 
I would like to learn more about chinese culture and not just the language. I would  like less 
homework and less  self study time  and  more hands on activities with the instructor if 
that's possible.
