PART 2: Please  answer the  following  self-reflection questions:
1. What  would you consider the most challenging  in lear  your language in this month?
         Writing sentences  that are gramatically correct and are natural. Whenever I take a test  I 
struggle to provide a  good translation of the english to Chinese, it's always a little awkward.
2. What  actions have  you  taken  that were  most helpful in meeting  your goals/challenges this 
month?
         I  have written a  lot of writing  assignments and go over them with  Laoshi.  It has greatly  
increased my fluency  and accuracy.
3. What  would you like  to focus on next month? 
More speaking! I think it's the best way  for me to learn.
